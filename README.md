# SNHU CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle Essential Questions:
# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
# "I think that considering user needs on a personal level is essential to crafting solutions that truly deliver what the user needs. User stories help by breaking down the functionality requirements into manageable sections that clearly state what is expected of the developer's solution."
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
# "After exposure to Agile and Scrum methodologies, I feel that my approach to developing programs will be less concerned with definitions that may change. I feel that focus on delivering working software is the prime directive. The Agile process that I value most is rolling wave planning." 
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
# "Being a good team member in software development means following the principles behind the Agile Manifesto, as well as being a person who has learned how to convey their opinions effectively to others in a professional manner. Chief among Agile principles, in my opinion, is the constant reflection and tuning in order to become a more effective team of software developers."
